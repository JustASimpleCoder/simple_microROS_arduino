Simple project to excplore how to use microROS with a sraspberry pi and arduino. 

I se up a simple arduino circuit that extends the simple single blink LED, to be able to blink 6 different LED based on a inputed pin. 
I set up a simple publisher node that publishes random numbers from 8 - 13 (corresponding to the pins that are connected to various LEDs).
